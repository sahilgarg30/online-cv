        authors: Ranjita Bhagwan, Sonu Mehta, Arjun Radhakrishna, <b>Sahil Garg</b>
        conference: The 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2021)
        link: "https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2021"
        description: Large services depend on correct configuration to run efficiently and seamlessly. Checking such configuration for correctness has become a very important
                     problem because services use a large and continuously increasing number of configuration files and parameters. Yet, very few such tools exist because the
                     definition of correctness for a configuration parameter is seldom specified or documented, existing either as tribal knowledge among a few domain experts
                     or not at all.
                     
                     In this paper, we address the problem of configuration pattern mining - learning configuration rules from example. Using program synthesis
                     and a novel string profiling algorithm, we show that we can use file contents and histories of commits to learn patterns in configuration. We have built
                     a tool called ConfMiner that implements configuration pattern mining and have deployed it on four large repositories containing configuration for a
                     large-scale enterprise service. Our evaluation shows that ConfMiner learns a large variety of configuration rules with high precision and is very useful in
                     flagging anomalous configuration. This work was also accepted as a US patent: Pattern based configuration verifier.

                As part of the parallel processing lab course, developed a parallel algorithm to solve the OGR-n (Optimal Golomb ruler) problem, a combinatorial 
                optimisation problem, believed to be NP-Hard using (i) MPI and (ii) CUDA standards. The algorithm uses collaborative mechanisms between processors with 
                effective load balancing for enhanced efficiency. Compared the execution timings for serial and parallel implementation to determine speedup, improved the efficiency by 87 percent.
